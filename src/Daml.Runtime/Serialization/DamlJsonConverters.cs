/// The <see cref="System.Text.Json"/> converters for the scalar types generated records and the

/// <see cref="ContractId{T}"/>, <see cref="SynchronizerId"/>, <see cref="CommandId"/>,
/// <see cref="ChoiceName"/> and <see cref="WorkflowId"/>, each of which serializes as a bare JSON
/// string rather than as an object — the same spelling PQS rows and JSON Ledger API payloads give
/// them — and <see cref="LedgerOffset"/>, which serializes as a bare JSON number, together with the
/// <see cref="EquatableArray{T}"/> every list member of the event and stream records carries,
/// which the built-in collection converter can write but not read,
/// <see cref="SubmitterInfo"/>, whose two get-only party sets no built-in reader can assign
/// through, <see cref="Set{T}"/>, whose constructor parameter binds to no property so that no
/// built-in reader can construct one at all, <see cref="Map{TKey, TValue}"/> and
/// <see cref="NonEmpty{T}"/>, whose own built-in reader constructs one but lets the
/// <see cref="ArgumentException"/> a null key, value or element trips escape
/// <see cref="JsonSerializer.Deserialize{TValue}(string, JsonSerializerOptions?)"/> unwrapped
/// rather than as the <see cref="JsonException"/> naming the offending index that <see cref="Set{T}"/>
/// reports, and the declared-abstract discriminated unions
/// <see cref="Optional{T}"/>, <see cref="Either{TL, TR}"/>,
/// <see cref="ContractStreamEvent{T}"/> and <see cref="InterfaceStreamEvent{TInterface, TView}"/>,
/// none of which the reflection-based serializer can write or read past their own base members —
/// together with <see cref="Daml.Runtime.Stdlib.Unit"/>, whose private constructor leaves the
/// reflection-based serializer nothing to call.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Every one of these types carries its converter as a
/// <see cref="JsonConverterAttribute"/>, <see cref="EquatableArray{T}"/> included, so plain
/// <c>JsonSerializer.Deserialize&lt;MyTemplate&gt;(json)</c> converts all of them with no
/// registration.
/// <para>
/// What that buys is a <em>CLR round-trip</em>: a value serialized by
/// <see cref="System.Text.Json"/> reads back as itself. It is not a decoder for a payload Canton
/// produced. Above these scalars the shapes diverge from the Daml-LF JSON encoding a participant
/// and PQS speak — a <c>Map</c> and a <c>NonEmpty</c> take the object contract
/// <see cref="System.Text.Json"/> derives from their members, and a generated record is read under
/// its C# member names rather than the <c>DamlFieldAttribute</c> labels the wire carries. Read a
/// ledger or PQS payload with <see cref="DamlLfJsonReader"/>, which is given the schema and
/// produces the right node for each slot.
/// </para>
/// What an attribute cannot reach is the rest of the posture, and that is what
/// <see cref="AddDamlConverters"/> is for: it sets
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.RespectNullableAnnotations"/> and marks required the
/// constructor parameters an absent member would bind to a value the payload never stated —
/// <see cref="EquatableArray{T}"/>, whose default is the empty list,
/// <see cref="LedgerOffset"/>, whose default is <see cref="LedgerOffset.Begin"/>, and the Daml
/// stdlib collections <see cref="Set{T}"/>, <see cref="Map{TKey, TValue}"/> and
/// <see cref="NonEmpty{T}"/>, whose default is a null their own slot forbids — so a payload
/// that omits one is refused rather than read as that value, a property the payload never
/// mentions never reaching a converter at all. It also lists the Daml conversions explicitly, for the
/// hosts that build their own <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions"/> — a ledger or PQS client's
/// default options, say — rather than inheriting them from attributes; a converter on
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.Converters"/> takes precedence over the one an attribute
/// names on the type.
/// <see cref="System.Text.Json"/> does not walk the base chain to find an inherited
/// attribute, so a type deriving from <see cref="ContractId{T}"/> needs one of its own.
/// The emitted <c>T.ContractId</c> is given that attribute by the codegen; a hand-written
/// derived contract id is not, and falls back to <c>{"Value":"..."}</c> unless registered
/// here.

    /// <para>
    /// The other half of that posture is the one no converter can supply: a property the

    /// indistinguishable from an event that genuinely named no witnesses, which is the
    /// distinction <see cref="CreatedContract.WitnessParties"/> and its siblings exist to carry
    /// — and a missing <see cref="LedgerOffset"/> as <see cref="LedgerOffset.Begin"/>,
    /// indistinguishable from a participant that genuinely reported the start of the stream and
