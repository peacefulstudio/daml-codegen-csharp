/// Shared read/write logic for the <see cref="System.Text.Json"/> converters of the runtime's

/// <see cref="Daml.Runtime.Stdlib.Either{TL, TR}"/>,

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Each union is written as its concrete arm's own JSON object, with a <c>"$case"</c>
/// discriminator naming the arm inserted as the first member, e.g.
/// <c>{"$case":"Some","Value":"c"}</c>. Reading looks the discriminator up in the caller-supplied
/// case map, strips the <c>"$case"</c> member, and deserializes the rest of the object at that
/// arm's concrete CLR type — stripped, rather than left for the arm's converter to see, because a
/// caller running under <see cref="System.Text.Json.Serialization.JsonUnmappedMemberHandling.Disallow"/>
/// would otherwise reject every read of every arm on the one member none of them declare. A
/// payload nested inside another instance of the same union —
/// <c>Optional&lt;Optional&lt;T&gt;&gt;</c> — is unambiguous: each level carries its own
/// discriminator. This is the CLR round-trip contract ADR 0028 describes, not the Daml-LF wire
/// encoding; a generated record's own field still reads and writes under its C# member names via
/// <see cref="Daml.Runtime.Serialization.DamlLfJsonReader"/> for the ledger, unrelated to this
/// shape.
/// </remarks>
/// <remarks>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Read{TUnion}"/> parses each arm's JSON subtree via
/// <c>JsonDocument.ParseValue(ref Utf8JsonReader)</c>, which continues the ambient
/// <see cref="Utf8JsonReader"/>'s own token-depth tracking rather than starting fresh — so a union
/// nested inside itself on the wire is already caught by <see cref="System.Text.Json"/>'s own reader
/// depth guard (threaded from <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.MaxDepth"/>) before any of this type's
/// code runs, with System.Text.Json's own <see cref="JsonException"/>. No extra guard is needed here.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Neither <see cref="Read{TUnion}"/> nor <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/> supports a
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.ReferenceHandler"/>: both reach the arm's payload through a
/// nested <see cref="JsonSerializer"/> call — <c>JsonNode.Deserialize</c> on read,
/// <c>JsonSerializer.SerializeToNode</c> on write — and each such call starts its own independent
/// reference resolver rather than continuing the ambient one the outer
/// <see cref="JsonSerializer.Serialize{TValue}(TValue, JsonSerializerOptions?)"/>/<c>Deserialize</c>
/// call is tracking. Under <see cref="System.Text.Json.Serialization.ReferenceHandler.Preserve"/> this
/// silently duplicates an aliased object instead of writing a <c>"$ref"</c> to it, with the duplicate
/// carrying a <c>"$id"</c> that can collide with one the outer scope already assigned; under
/// <see cref="System.Text.Json.Serialization.ReferenceHandler.IgnoreCycles"/> a genuine cycle through one of these types is never
/// recognized as a cycle, so it recurses until <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/>'s own nesting-depth guard
/// above throws a <see cref="JsonException"/> that reads as a nesting-depth problem rather than the
/// reference cycle it actually is. Both methods therefore refuse outright, with a
/// <see cref="JsonException"/> naming the union type, whenever
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.ReferenceHandler"/> is set — the same fail-fast posture as an
/// unrecognized <c>"$case"</c> — rather than let either failure mode through silently or misleadingly.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/> is different: it serializes each arm via
/// <c>JsonSerializer.SerializeToNode(object?, Type, JsonSerializerOptions?)</c>, which starts a fresh,
/// independent serialization rather than continuing the ambient one, so a union nested inside itself
/// re-enters this type at CLR-call-stack cost for every level, and
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.MaxDepth"/> is only checked once the arm's whole node tree has
/// already been built in memory — a build deep enough to be dangerous can already have overrun the
/// stack before that check ever runs. <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/> therefore tracks its own effective
/// nesting depth — the ambient <see cref="Utf8JsonWriter.CurrentDepth"/> at the point each arm is
/// about to be written, plus a thread-static baseline carried across the nested
/// <c>SerializeToNode</c> calls that separate one union from the next — rather than counting only
/// how many times <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/> itself has re-entered. Ordinary record layers written
/// between two unions still cost real call-stack depth through System.Text.Json's own recursive
/// writer even though they never re-enter this method, so a guard that counted only union-to-union
/// hops could stay far below <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.MaxDepth"/> while the real, ordinary-
/// layers-included depth had already reached it. <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/> fails with a
/// <see cref="JsonException"/> once this effective depth reaches the caller's own
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.MaxDepth"/> — or <see cref="DefaultMaxDepth"/> when unset,
/// mirroring <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.MaxDepth"/>'s own default of 64 — never a lower,
/// hardcoded cap, so a caller who raises <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.MaxDepth"/> opts into deeper
/// recursion exactly as System.Text.Json itself allows.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/> serializes the chosen arm — <c>value</c>'s own runtime type, e.g.
/// <c>Optional&lt;string&gt;.Some</c> — via
/// <c>JsonSerializer.SerializeToNode(value, armType, options)</c>, and <see cref="Read{TUnion}"/>
/// deserializes it back via <c>armNode.Deserialize(armType, options)</c>; both calls resolve
/// <c>armType</c>'s own converter the same way any other <see cref="JsonSerializer"/> call would.
/// Each factory's <c>CanConvert</c> also matches its union's arm types directly (not only the
/// closed union type itself), so that a caller whose variable is statically typed as the arm —
/// not the declared-abstract union — still resolves to this converter once the factory is
/// registered, e.g. via <see cref="DamlJsonConverters.AddDamlConverters"/>:
/// <see cref="JsonConverterAttribute"/> is not inherited by a derived type, so an attribute on the
/// union alone leaves the arm type on the default reflection-based contract, producing JSON with
/// no <c>"$case"</c> that cannot be read back as the union. But resolving <c>armType</c> through
/// the very <c>options</c> that made it match in the first place would recurse into this same
/// converter forever — on write, the "write the arm's own plain fields" step would immediately
/// rediscover "this type is a union arm" and try to write them again; on read, the arm's payload
/// has already had its <c>"$case"</c> member stripped, so the same converter re-entering on it
/// would immediately fail as if the discriminator were missing. <see cref="Write{TUnion}"/> and
/// <see cref="Read{TUnion}"/> therefore run that step against <see cref="ArmOptions"/>, a copy of
/// <c>options</c> with every <see cref="IDiscriminatedUnionJsonConverterFactory"/> removed from
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.Converters"/> — cached per <c>options</c> instance, since
/// <see cref="JsonSerializerOptions.Converters"/> takes precedence over a
/// <see cref="JsonConverterAttribute"/> on the type (see
/// <see cref="DamlJsonConverters.AddDamlConverters"/>'s remarks), removing it there is enough to
/// let <c>armType</c> fall through to its plain shape without an attribute on the arm type itself,
/// which would suffer the identical recursion with no equivalent escape. A union nested inside the
/// arm through the base type — <c>Optional&lt;Optional&lt;int&gt;&gt;</c> — is unaffected: the
/// inner <c>Optional&lt;int&gt;</c> is never itself a union's arm, so it keeps resolving through
/// its own <see cref="JsonConverterAttribute"/> exactly as before.
