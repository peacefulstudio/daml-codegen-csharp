# `splice-api-token-transfer-instruction-v2` codegen snapshot

`DriftDetectionTests` regenerates C# from the vendored `intermediate.binpb`
(the `IntermediateDar` proto for this package) and asserts byte-equal output
against the `expected/` tree. When a codegen change legitimately alters the
generated output, refresh the `expected/` snapshot.

## Why this DAR

The Token Standard V2 TransferInstruction / TransferFactory interface package
(CIP-0112).

## About `using` directives

Each generated file emits only the namespaces its body actually references,
tracked at codegen time. No generated file emits an unused `using`, so the
generated headers carry no `#pragma warning disable CS8019`.

## Refreshing the snapshot

`scripts/refresh-snapshot.sh` regenerates `intermediate.binpb` from the vendored
DAR with a JVM helper assembled from the working tree's sources, then
regenerates the `expected/` tree from that proto with the current codegen
source. Pass `--skip-binpb` to keep the vendored proto and refresh only
`expected/`. Run it from the repo root (POSIX shell; on Windows, use WSL or Git
Bash):

```bash
scripts/refresh-snapshot.sh splice-api-token-transfer-instruction-v2
```

## The vendored inputs

`intermediate.binpb` is the canonical codegen input for the drift test;
`splice-api-token-transfer-instruction-v2.dar` is the upstream Splice archive
it was derived from (`splice-api-token-transfer-instruction-v2-1.0.0.dar` from
the Splice `0.7.5` `splice-node` release tarball), kept alongside as the
frozen upstream artifact and used as the regeneration input. Do not hand-edit
`intermediate.binpb`: the refresh script regenerates it from this DAR on every
run, and CI regenerates it the same way and fails on any byte delta. If the
upstream Splice package genuinely needs to advance, replace the files in
place, refresh the snapshot per the procedure above, and call out the version
bump in the pull request description.
