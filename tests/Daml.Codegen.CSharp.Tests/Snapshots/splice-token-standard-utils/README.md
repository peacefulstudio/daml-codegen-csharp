# `splice-token-standard-utils` codegen snapshot

`DriftDetectionTests` regenerates C# from the vendored `intermediate.binpb`
(the `IntermediateDar` proto for this package) and asserts byte-equal output
against the `expected/` tree.

This package emits no C# types, so its snapshot is pinned by the
`emits-no-types` marker file in this directory: the drift test asserts that
codegen produces zero `.cs` output, and the publish-time guard reads the same
marker before accepting an empty generated tree. The day the package starts
emitting a type, both fail, so the change is caught rather than shipped
unnoticed.

## Why this DAR

The Token Standard V2 helper library — a non-`vN` package (version 2.0.0). It
is a library of Daml functions and re-exports of types that are owned by the V2
API packages, so it defines no serializable data types of its own and the C#
codegen emits nothing for it. Pinning it as an `emits-no-types` snapshot puts
that fact under drift detection: if a future Splice release adds a
codegen-visible type to the library, or an emitter change starts emitting one,
the drift test flags it instead of letting the new surface ship unnoticed.

## The `emits-no-types` marker

The `emits-no-types` file in this directory marks the snapshot as expecting
zero generated `.cs`. When a package legitimately gains a codegen-visible type,
remove the marker and refresh the `expected/` snapshot so it pins the emitted
types instead.

## Refreshing the snapshot

`scripts/refresh-snapshot.sh` regenerates `intermediate.binpb` from the vendored
DAR with a JVM helper assembled from the working tree's sources, then
regenerates the `expected/` tree from that proto with the current codegen
source. Pass `--skip-binpb` to keep the vendored proto and refresh only
`expected/`. Run it from the repo root (POSIX shell; on Windows, use WSL or Git
Bash):

```bash
scripts/refresh-snapshot.sh splice-token-standard-utils
```

## The vendored inputs

`intermediate.binpb` is the canonical codegen input for the drift test;
`splice-token-standard-utils.dar` is the upstream Splice archive it was
derived from (`splice-token-standard-utils-2.0.0.dar` from the Splice `0.7.5`
`splice-node` release tarball), kept alongside as the frozen upstream artifact
and used as the regeneration input. Do not hand-edit `intermediate.binpb`: the
refresh script regenerates it from this DAR on every run, and CI regenerates
it the same way and fails on any byte delta. If the upstream Splice package
genuinely needs to advance, replace the files in place, refresh the snapshot
per the procedure above, and call out the version bump in the pull request
description.
